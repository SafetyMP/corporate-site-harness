# Site delivery

1. Verify `corporate-handoff.json` digests before acting.
2. Resolve `program.site_path` from
   `corp-harness status --root <corporate-folder>`. Call `move_agent_to_root`
   with that path, then confirm the active workspace root equals `site_path`.
   If the move fails, is unavailable, is declined, or the root is still not
   `site_path`: **stop immediately**. Do not implement or continue site roles
   from the corporate/factory root. Tell the user the required `site_path` and
   wait for them to open/switch that workspace (or approve the root move)
   before resuming. If a site manifest exists, handoff `site_id` must match
   `.corp-harness/site.json` `site_id`.
3. For `program_kind: product`, edit only the product site root. Never modify
   factory sources (`src/corp_harness/**`) or factory plugin sources from a site
   workspace. Portfolio platform work is not site delivery.
4. For `program_kind: factory`, confirm user `factory_authorization` is current
   before implementing authorized surfaces under the factory checkout.
   Optional assist: `corp-harness gov check-authorized-surfaces --root <corp>
   --path <rel>` (after existence checks) audits allow/deny without mutating
   `program.json`. Agents never pass `--actor user` via gov assist.
5. Use the site manager to create consequential ADRs and bounded work packets.
   Enforce packet limits from execution_policy (one ADR; path/acceptance caps).
   Persist a root receipt before any specialist launch.
6. Capture → archive → dispatch → implement. Recapture/dispatch use `fast`
   models via the model-routing skill; never start premium coding under an
   expiring freshness window.
7. The root orchestrator runs `corp-harness route-model` before each Task and
   launches site specialists in isolated worktrees under `.worktrees/<packet-id>`
   with the routed `model=`. Packet `execution_target` defaults to `worktree`.
   Opt-in `isolated_copy`, `openshell:<name>`, or `cloud_subagent` is placement
   only (depth-1 worker, not extra nesting). Reserved OpenShell names `hermes`,
   `pi`, `eval` are illegal as `openshell:<name>` and as `site_path`. Connect
   with `openshell sandbox connect <name>` from a Mac terminal; never
   `--editor cursor`. Premium only for escalated `hard_implement` /
   complexity `packet_implement` / post-failure `remediate`. Never `git add`
   or commit `.worktrees/` paths into the site/factory root (they are ephemeral
   and gitignored); parent `git status` dirt from those paths is a lifecycle
   failure, not success evidence.
8. Integrate from the site root and run `scripts/harness/verify.sh`. After
   integrate/verify (or when a packet is abandoned), remove the finished
   worktree (`git worktree remove` / discard) so it cannot re-dirty the parent
   tree. Do not leave completed packet worktrees around. A green isolated run
   is not a named-gate PASS.
9. Record `verification_scripts` as site-relative `scripts/harness` containing only
   `verify.sh` and `adversarial.sh`. Never bind the whole `scripts/` tree.
10. Ask operations excellence to inspect fresh evidence and model attestations
    (`corp-harness check --attest-packet …`); producers cannot approve it.
11. On abort, write a resume checkpoint and resume on standard/fast unless a
    valid premium escalation exists. Return failures to the owning ADR with a
    new revision. Never bypass the attempt budget.
