# Site contract

## Gates

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `./scripts/harness/verify.sh` | Functional and static acceptance |
| `./scripts/harness/adversarial.sh` | Authorized local adversarial probes |

Record `verification_scripts` as the site directory `scripts/harness` (exactly those
two scripts). Optional wrappers may remain at `scripts/verify.sh` /
`scripts/adversarial.sh` for humans; they are outside the digest boundary.

The corporate handoff fixes scope. The site manager assigns ADRs; site specialists write;
operations excellence reviews current evidence. Work in isolated roots, never edit
corporate approval state, and never self-approve.
